                    </div>
                    <p>Cotton is fully mature and ready for harvesting approximately 160 days  after being planted. Once the bolls have burst open, the farmers can prepare the cotton plants for harvesting. One of the biggest threats to a cotton crop is weather—rain, specifically—so it must be harvested on time to avoid damage, which would negatively impact yield.</p>

                    <p>There are a few different ways that you can spin yarn, but the most common ways of spinning as far as bed linen and towels are concerned are open-end spinning, ring spinning, or compact spinning.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Weaving is a process in which two sets of yarns are weaved together to make a fabric. The lengthway threads, known as the warp and cross way threads known as the weft, are interlaced on a loom to form the desired fabric.</p>

                    <p>Fabric finishing is a series of processes that includes both physical and chemical finishes that work to convert the griege (loom-state) cloth into finished fabric. Finishing adds value to the product and makes it fit for use in the end product.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The next sage is stitching the fabrics together to make the final product. This stitching process is known as hemming. In hemming the edge of a piece of fabric is folded and sewn. This is done to prevent the separating of the fabric and to adjust the length of the final product.</p>
